### Heyyy 🧙, I am Ludovic

NetOps/NetDev Engineer with a Master’s degree in Network and Telecommunications and another in Cybersecurity. My work is driven by a strong commitment to privacy and open-source projects.

I am passionate about automation, software development, and contributing to open-source projects.

I use NixOS as my daily driver for its reproducibility and robustness, alongside GrapheneOS for its strong security and privacy guarantees.
